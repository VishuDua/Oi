Oi Voice Assistant

Overview
The AI Conversational Assistant Suite is a fully integrated, modular system designed for real-time speech interaction and intelligent responses. It combines Speech-to-Text (STT), Text Generation (LLM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to deliver seamless AI-driven conversations with emotion-aware contextual replies.
The suite is structured around four key components:
- Speech-to-Text (STT) ‚Äì Captures and transcribes voice input, identifying speakers dynamically.
- Text Generation (LLM) ‚Äì Processes user queries and generates intelligent responses using Mistral-7B-Instruct.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) ‚Äì Converts AI-generated text responses into high-quality synthesized speech using Jenny TTS.
- Controller Module ‚Äì Oversees and synchronizes all processes for efficient execution.
This project is ideal for virtual assistants, AI-powered customer service, and research in natural language processing and emotional AI.

Features
üîä Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Speaker Identification using voice embeddings with Resemblyzer.
- Real-time transcription leveraging Whisper AI for high accuracy.
- Multi-threaded audio processing for optimized performance.
- Automatic data logging for structured transcript management.
üß† Text Generation (LLM)
- Context-aware responses powered by Mistral-7B-Instruct.
- Emotion detection using GoEmotions BERT model to adjust AI tone dynamically.
- Flask-based API to handle user requests efficiently.
- Interactive conversation memory for better engagement.
üéß Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Natural voice synthesis using Jenny TTS for fluid AI speech generation.
- Optimized text cleanup to remove unnecessary characters for TTS readability.
- Customizable sample rate for high-quality audio playback.
- Threaded audio streaming for minimal latency in speech response.
üîó Controller Module
- Process management for launching STT, LLM, and TTS seamlessly.
- Subprocess monitoring to track real-time output.
- Error handling mechanisms ensuring stability and recovery from failures.
- Virtual environment support for modular execution.

Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.8) and that your system supports GPU-based execution (optional but recommended for faster processing).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency Installation
Install all required dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Setup
- Download and place the Mistral-7B-Instruct model in the designated directory.
- Ensure Whisper AI and Resemblyzer are installed.
- Verify Jenny TTS model availability.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration
Modify the environment paths in the controller script:
STT_ENV = "path_to_stt_venv/bin/python"
TEXT_GEN_ENV = "path_to_text_gen_venv/bin/python"
TTS_ENV = "path_to_tts_venv/bin/python"



Usage
üöÄ Launching the AI Assistant
Start all modules with:
python assistant_controller.py


This will:
- Initialize STT to process voice input.
- Trigger LLM for response generation.
- Convert AI replies to speech via TTS.
- Monitor and synchronize processes.
üì° API Endpoints
- /transcript?mode=plain ‚Äì Fetch a clean transcription.
- /transcript?mode=speaker ‚Äì Retrieve transcripts with speaker attribution.
- /respond ‚Äì Generate AI response from user input.
- /toggle_mode ‚Äì Switch between voice and text interaction modes.
- /status ‚Äì View system diagnostics (active threads, memory usage, etc.).
